    "## Using ChatGPT for NLP labeling of the water-year summaries dataset\n",
    "#### NOTE THAT CODE DOES NOT RUN AND IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.\n",
    "- Code may be easily adapted for usage in other NLP, though note that a new openAI API key is needed. They are free with your account and is preloaded with 18.00$ of requests.\n",
    "### Introduction to OpenAI: \n",
    "ChatGPT is a recently developed powerful Natural Language Processing machine learning model. Its primary use has been for user interaction and personal use. It can be adapted to solve many complex problems and is trained on a large variety of data. We aimed to use this technology to process the location, gauge, and remark information about a particular stream gauge site collected from the USGS. Our goal is to filter sites that do not fit our criteria for valid stream gauge sites. Criteria can be easily adapted in this approach, however for this project we want sites that convey the natural data without man-made changes. This includes but is not limited to, dams, concrete stream beds, irrigation diversions, and other forms of impactful man-made structures. Note that this code was not used in the final testing of the model, but found some use in regular classification.\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- Very interpretable and easy to understand.\n",
    "- Setting up is not too difficult.\n",
    "- Changing criteria is trivial.\n",
    "- Very powerful NLP model.\n",
    "- Does not need to be trained and tuning is minimal.\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- Not consistent in producing correctly formatted output.\n",
    "- Language used in remarks and descriptions is diffrent from state to state, making labeling difficult.\n",
    "- Openai charges requests made to the API and thus is not completely free. Note that there is a free trial that includes more than enough for most single projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assosiated Files:\n",
    "- modelTesting.txt: Some call and response from given prompts, real data, and fabricated data. See file for details on testing.\n",
    "- openai_test_data: File of Washington stream gauges, contains location, remarks, and gauge information.\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Though it was most definitely an interesting idea, prompt engineering is much too variable for consistent use in this project. With the usage of different kinds of language and the ease in which GPT-3 gets confused with complicated prompts, it does not make sense to continue to attempt to use this model. Note that OpenAI has different kinds of models, some of which can be trained and even more finely tuned. "
