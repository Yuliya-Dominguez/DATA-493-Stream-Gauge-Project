Castle Lake would have overtopped the blockage in late 1981 or early 1982. Overtopping most probably would have resulted in a quick release of lake waters as a result of rapid erosion of the blockage. Serious flooding probably would have resulted from the breakout of Castle Lake. As a result, the level of Castle Lake was stabilized with the construction of a spillway in 1981.
